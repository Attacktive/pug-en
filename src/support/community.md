## GitHub

We use GitHub issues exclusively as a bugs and feature requests tracker. If you think you have found a bug, or have a new feature idea, please start by making sure it hasn't already been reported or fixed. You can search through existing issues and pull requests to see if someone has reported one similar to yours.
