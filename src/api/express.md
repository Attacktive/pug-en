# Express Integration

Pug fully integrates with [Express], a popular Node.js web framework, as a supported view engine. Check out Express's excellent [guide][Express guide] for how to integrate Pug with Express.

## Production Defaults

In Express, the environmental variable `NODE_ENV` is designed to inform the web application of the execution environment: whether it is in development or in production. Express and Pug automatically modify the defaults of a few options in production environment, to provide a better out-of-the-box experience for users. 

Specifically, when `process.env.NODE_ENV` is set to `'production'`, and Pug is used with Express, the <code>[compileDebug]</code> option is `false` by default, while the <code>[cache]</code> option is `true`.

To override the defaults for `compileDebug` and `cache`, you can set the respective property in `app.locals` or `res.locals` objects to `true` or `false`. The `cache` option can also be overriden through Express's `app.disable`/`enable('view cache')`.
